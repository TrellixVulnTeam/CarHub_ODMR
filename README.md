# CarHub

A web application for car enthusiasts built on the MERN stack with a Python executable accessed using shell instructions. The web application is a one in all stop for enthusiasts and has a database of cars which can be presented in order of top speed, power, engine specs and constructor. The cars are also clustered togther using K-means algorithm based on all these parameters to show cars similar to a user's search. A neural network on python using keras and tensorflow has also been incorporated that can disambiguate the make of a car given its image.
